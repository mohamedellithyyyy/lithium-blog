        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Mathematics is like a magical adventure that people have been exploring for thousands of years. It's a way of understanding numbers, shapes, and patterns that help us solve problems, build amazing structures, and even reach the stars. Let's travel back in time and discover the exciting history of mathematics, from its very beginning to where it stands today! </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Ancient Beginnings:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Long, long ago, even before there were big cities and cars, ancient people were already using math. They counted using their fingers and toes, which is why we have a base-10 system (we count to ten before starting over). They learned that they could use stones and lines in the sand to help them add and subtract. Imagine living in a world without numbers – that's how important math was even back then!</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Egyptian Marvels:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The ancient Egyptians were like math superheroes. They used math to measure fields for farming, build pyramids, and even keep track of time using giant sundials. They figured out how to calculate areas of squares and triangles, helping them plan the shapes of their buildings. The pyramids, with their perfectly shaped sides, are a testament to their math skills.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Greek Thinkers:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">A long time ago, in a place called Greece, some very clever people started thinking deeply about math. One of these smart minds was Pythagoras, who loved triangles. He discovered the famous Pythagorean theorem, which helps us find the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. Another great thinker, Euclid, wrote a big book called "Elements" that explained lots of math ideas and became one of the most important books in history.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Indian Numbers:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Imagine trying to do math without numbers like 1, 2, or 3! Thanks to the brilliant minds in ancient India, we have these numbers today. They also introduced the idea of zero, which is like a placeholder that helps us write big numbers. Can you imagine a world without zero? It would be tricky to do many math problems!</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Amazing Arab Scholars:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">As time went on, the Arab world became a hub for learning and math. Scholars like Al-Khwarizmi developed a way of solving tricky equations, which we now call algebra. The word "algebra" actually comes from the title of his book "Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala." These ideas traveled to Europe and changed the way people did math forever.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Modern Marvels:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In recent times, math has helped humans achieve incredible things. From sending rockets to space to creating amazing computer programs, math is at the heart of it all. Computers, which you use to play games and learn, rely on math to work. Math is also helping scientists understand the secrets of the universe, from the tiniest particles to the vast galaxies.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion:</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Mathematics has a fascinating history that stretches across thousands of years and many different cultures. It's like a puzzle that people have been solving bit by bit, making the world a better place with each discovery. So, the next time you're playing with numbers or noticing patterns, remember that you're continuing a journey that started long, long ago – a journey of exploring the wonders of mathematics!</p>
